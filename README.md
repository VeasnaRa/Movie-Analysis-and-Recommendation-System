# Movie-Analysis-and-Recommendation-System
Exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and applying Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing(NLP) for movie recommendations system.

## Overview
This project explores the **IMDB Movie Dataset** with data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations. It also includes a **content-based movie recommendation system** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

## ‚ö° Features
- Data cleaning (missing values, duplicates, outliers)  
- Exploratory analysis & visualizations (ratings, revenue, votes, trends)  
- Categorization of movies (Excellent, Good, Average)  
- **NLP-based Recommendation system**: suggests top 10 similar movies to a given title

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis
Some of the insights explored:
- Missing values and duplicates in the dataset
- Outlier detection for features like Rating, Votes, Revenue, Metascore
- Yearly trends in average votes and revenue
- Top 10 movies by rating and revenue
- Correlation heatmap for numerical features
- Distribution of Ratings, Votes, and Revenue

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)  
- Difflib (fuzzy title matching)
